<h3 align="Left">     What is KeyLogger ?     </h3>

<p>* A computer program that records every keystroke made by a computer user, especially in order to gain fraudulent access to passwords and other confidential information.</p>

<p>* Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit â€“ all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type.</p>

The keylogger that I've made is a basic keylogger with not much functionality.

It captures your keystrokes and saves them in a file "keylogger.txt".

It then sends the contents of the file(i.e. the keystrokes) to your email id.

SYNTAX : python3 keylogger.py

[NOTE: You need to press esc key to exit out the keylogger.]

You need to have pynput , smtplib and ssl installed.

While python comes with the library smtplib and ssl preinstalled.



You can install pynput with : pip install pynput
